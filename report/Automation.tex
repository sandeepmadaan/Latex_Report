\begin{block}{Django}
\Django Django is an open source web application framework written in python. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly. Django focuses on automating as much as possible. Django adopts the standard MVC(Model-View-Controller) design pattern. But instead, their naming convention is the MTV(Model-Template-View).\\

\begin{description}
\item[Model] is an object relational mapping to your database schema. So each model is a class which represent a table in your database.
\item[Template] is simply HTML for your views. It also allows you to display different messages depending on whether or not a user logged in.

\begin{frame}{MySql}
\begin{block}{MySql}
Although Django supports all the Databases like sqlite, Mysql, postgresql etc but I used the Mysql. Mysql is worldâ€™s most popular open source database. MySQL is written in C and C++. Free-software-open source projects that require a full-featured database management system often use MySQL.\\
         One of the greatest advantage of Django is that it synchronises the database only with one command without having any need to send different queries for insertion, deletion, updation etc. There is a file named models.py which is used for purpose of creating database.The command used for database synchronisation is \\
